# parcel_info
A simple python delivery tracker for FedEx, UPS and USPS.

It suppose to do one thing:
Return the estimated or actual delivery time, and the current status.

The system uses public API. If you have large volume, you should not use this, 
but instead seek to obtain actual API keys from the carriers and work with their system.

The code is just for my own use, hence it will not support more features unless I need those features.
